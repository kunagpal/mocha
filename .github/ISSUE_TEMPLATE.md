### Prerequisites

* [ ] Checked next-gen ES issues and syntax problems by using the same environment and/or transpiler configuration without Mocha to ensure it isn't just a feature that actually isn't supported in the environment in question or a bug in the user's code.
* [ ] 'Smoke tested' the code to be tested by running it outside the real test suite to get a better sense of whether the problem is in the code under test, the user's usage of Mocha, or Mocha itself
